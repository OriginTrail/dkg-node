***

### 5. Nature of the Network - No OriginTrail Control

5.1 OriginTrail developed the OriginTrail V10 Node software, licensed under the Apache License 2.0, and may promote it as an open-source network. **HOWEVER, YOU SHALL AT ALL TIMES NOTE THAT ORIGINTRAIL DOES NOT OWN OR CONTROL THE OriginTrail V10 NETWORK, THE DECENTRALIZED KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, ANY SUPPORTED CHAIN, OR ANY RELATED SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER MODIFICATION TO IT, AND YOU ARE SOLELY AND IN FULL RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF EACH AND ANY OF THEM.**

5.2 You acknowledge and agree that:

(a) OriginTrail does not own, operate, or control any Node, Agent, Context Graph, Verified Graph, Knowledge Asset, Publisher Conviction Account, Staker Conviction Position, or wallet, except any infrastructure OriginTrail itself chooses to operate in its capacity as one participant among many;

(b) OriginTrail does not have any authority to approve, prevent, restrict, censor, reverse, or otherwise exercise control over any transaction, publication, endorsement, verification, update, deletion, or any other interaction that occurs through OriginTrail V10 or any Supported Chain;

(c) You shall not have any expectation as to the performance of the OriginTrail V10 network, the uptime or behaviour of any individual Node, or the compensation paid to any Publisher, Staker, Node operator, or Agent;

(d) Where OriginTrail or its affiliates publish opinions, roadmaps, forecasts, or community communications, such materials are provided for informational purposes only, do not create a contractual obligation, and may be changed or withdrawn at any time.

***

### 6. Node Operation

6.1 You are responsible for the installation, configuration, security, maintenance, and operation of any Node You run, including keeping the Node software reasonably up to date with published releases at [https://github.com/OriginTrail](https://github.com/OriginTrail) and ensuring the secure custody of all associated private keys.

6.2 To operate a Core Node, You must satisfy the minimum technical and economic requirements described in the Technical Documentation. Failure to meet these requirements may, pursuant to protocol-level rules enforced by other participants and smart contracts, result in reduced reputation, reduced allocation of publishing work, or inability to participate in certain operations. OriginTrail does not operate any discretionary disciplinary process - any consequences are the result of protocol rules and the independent behaviour of other network participants.

6.3 You acknowledge that the OriginTrail V10 Node Source Code has not necessarily passed a third-party security audit and can be potentially unstable and could cause unexpected effects and system failures. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the OriginTrail V10 Node Source Code or any Derivative Work.

6.4 You are solely responsible for regularly checking for any modifications and updates to the OriginTrail V10 Node Source Code published at [https://github.com/OriginTrail](https://github.com/OriginTrail).

6.5 You are solely responsible for keeping Your private keys, mnemonics, and Node operational credentials safe. **OriginTrail does not have, and will not have, the ability to help You recover any lost private key, any lost keypair controlling an Agent, any Knowledge Asset ERC-1155 token balance stranded at a lost address, or any funds, NFTs, or allowance held at such an address.**&#x20;

***

### 7. TRAC, Conviction Positions, and Token Economics

7.1 **Utility character of TRAC.** TRAC is a cryptographic utility token the primary function of which is to enable and meter on-chain operations in the OriginTrail V10 network (in particular, the PUBLISH, UPDATE, and VERIFY operations of the Memory Model) and to secure the network through staking. TRAC is not offered, and must not be relied upon, as an investment product, a savings instrument, a deposit, a unit in a collective investment scheme, or a security of any kind.

7.2 **Publisher Conviction.** Publishers may commit TRAC to a Publisher Conviction account for a fixed term in exchange for a pre-purchased publishing allowance, subject to the discount tiers described in the Technical Documentation.&#x20;

7.3 **Delegated Staker Conviction.** Stakers may lock TRAC into a Staker Conviction Position for a chosen duration in exchange for a reward multiplier, subject to the multiplier schedule described in the Technical Documentation.&#x20;

7.4 **Programmatic Rewards.** Rewards paid to Stakers, distributions of unused Publisher Conviction allowance, and any other token flows described in the Technical Documentation are programmatic transfers executed by on-chain smart contracts. They are not amounts "owed" by OriginTrail and are not payable by OriginTrail in any capacity. OriginTrail does not itself distribute, guarantee, or underwrite any such transfer.

7.5 **Gas and operational costs.** In addition to TRAC, every blockchain transaction on a Supported Chain requires the payment of gas in that blockchain's native gas token (including, where applicable, NEURO on NeuroWeb, ETH on Base, and xDAI on Gnosis). You are solely responsible for obtaining and managing such gas tokens.

7.6 **Knowledge commerce and x402.** You acknowledge that, in addition to protocol-level TRAC payments, the OriginTrail V10 network supports knowledge commerce via x402 HTTP micropayments and - in later protocol releases - FairSwap on-chain escrow, settling in TRAC, USDC, or other tokens configured by the serving Node or Publisher. OriginTrail does not operate any x402 or FairSwap endpoint on Your behalf, does not guarantee the availability, performance, or pricing of such endpoints, and is not a party to any commercial transaction concluded between You and any other Agent, Publisher, or Node operator via such mechanisms.

7.7 **Not a security; no investment solicitation**. You acknowledge and agree that:

(a) Neither TRAC, nor Publisher Conviction Accounts, nor Staker Conviction Positions, nor Knowledge Assets, nor Context Graph or Verified Graph tokens, are offered or intended as securities, investment contracts, collective investment schemes, units in a fund, derivatives, or any other form of regulated financial instrument;

(b) You are not acquiring or holding any such asset with an expectation of profit derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of OriginTrail or any third party acting on OriginTrail's behalf;

(c) Any statements made by OriginTrail in the Technical Documentation, roadmaps, or elsewhere regarding network design, conviction mechanisms, discount curves, reward multipliers, or market dynamics are informational and architectural in nature, and are not offers, promises, guarantees, or forecasts of financial return;

(d) Where the laws of Your jurisdiction would, notwithstanding the foregoing, characterise any component of the OriginTrail V10 network as a regulated instrument, You are solely responsible for complying with all such laws, including securities, commodities, crypto-asset (including, where applicable, the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets regime), anti-money-laundering, tax, and consumer-protection laws.

***

### 8. Agents and Keys

8.1 You may operate one or more Agents. Each Agent is identified by a cryptographic keypair that You (or the automated system operating on Your behalf) generate and control. Agent creation is free at the protocol level and does not require registration with OriginTrail.

8.2 You are solely responsible for:

(a) The generation, storage, rotation, and protection of each Agent's private key;

(b) Any and all operations signed by any Agent under Your control;

(c) The conduct of any automated or "agentic" software operating under Your authority, including the content it publishes, the commitments it makes, the TRAC or other tokens it spends, and the wallets it signs for. **The autonomous or probabilistic character of an Agent is not a defence and does not shift responsibility to OriginTrail or to any other participant.**

8.3 If a key controlling an Agent is lost, compromised, or stolen, the current protocol does not provide social or off-chain recovery. You acknowledge that in such a case, You may permanently lose authority over Knowledge Assets or any other assets held at that Agent's address.&#x20;

***

### 9. Content Responsibility

9.1 All data that You, Your Agents, or Nodes under Your control publish, endorse, or verify on the OriginTrail V10 network is published by You on Your own authority. You warrant that any such data:

(a) Does not infringe any copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, publicity, privacy, or other intellectual property or personal right of any third party;

(b) Does not contain unlawful, defamatory, deceptive, or misleading content;

(c) Is, to the extent it contains personal data, processed by You in compliance with all applicable data protection laws (including, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation); and

(d) May be replicated, stored, and served by other Nodes on the network in accordance with protocol rules, and - in the case of Verified Memory - may be anchored permanently on one or more Supported Chains in a manner that You accept is technically impossible to reverse.

9.2 **Once knowledge is published to Verified Memory, its merkle root is anchored on blockchain and the underlying triples are replicated across Nodes within the relevant Context Graph. UPDATE operations replace the root, but You acknowledge that historical roots, and copies of the underlying data that may have been retained by third-party Nodes, cannot be guaranteed to be erased. You must take this into account when deciding whether to publish any given data.**

***

### 10. Risk Disclosures

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

10.1 **Technology risk.** The OriginTrail V10 Node Source Code, Agents, smart contracts, and protocol specifications are complex software. They may contain undiscovered defects, vulnerabilities, or bugs that could lead to loss of TRAC, Knowledge Assets, Conviction positions, or other value.

10.2 **Multi-chain risk.** OriginTrail V10 operates across multiple Supported Chains, including NeuroWeb, Base, and Gnosis. Each Supported Chain is an independent system operated by independent actors and validators, outside the control of OriginTrail. Any Supported Chain may experience outages, forks, consensus failures, re-organisations, governance disputes, regulatory action, or termination. OriginTrail makes no representation as to the availability, finality, or security of any Supported Chain, and You accept that Your assets or positions on any given Supported Chain may be adversely affected by events specific to that blockchain.

10.3 **Cross-chain risk.** Operations that rely on state, tokens, or messages bridged between Supported Chains introduce bridge-specific risks, including smart-contract exploits, validator misbehaviour, loss of canonicality, and temporary or permanent loss of assets in transit. You are solely responsible for evaluating and bearing such risks.

10.4 **Lock-up risk.** TRAC committed to a Publisher Conviction Account or a Staker Conviction Position is locked for a specific duration. During these lock periods, You cannot withdraw the locked tokens. Any secondary-market transfers of the NFT are neither guaranteed nor underwritten.

10.5 **Reward volatility and conditionality**. Staker rewards, Publisher allowance utilisation, and any other programmatic transfers are determined by network activity, gas conditions, and smart-contract execution. Rewards may decrease, pause, or cease altogether. No minimum, guaranteed, or target return is promised by OriginTrail.

10.6 **Stablecoin and payment-rail risk.** x402 micropayments and FairSwap escrow may settle in USDC or other non-TRAC tokens. Such tokens are issued, operated, or controlled by third parties and carry their own risks (including, without limitation, issuer risk, banking risk, peg failure, freezes, blocklists, and regulatory action). OriginTrail does not issue, endorse, or guarantee any such token.

10.7 **Regulatory risk.** The regulatory treatment of crypto-assets, decentralized networks, autonomous software agents, and related activities is evolving worldwide and varies between jurisdictions. Actions or determinations by regulators, courts, or legislatures may adversely affect the availability or value of OriginTrail V10, TRAC, Conviction NFTs, Knowledge Assets, or other positions. You are solely responsible for monitoring and complying with such developments in every jurisdiction relevant to You.

10.8 **Tax risk.** You are solely responsible for determining any tax consequences of Your participation in OriginTrail V10, including in connection with minting, holding, transferring, or selling any Conviction NFT or Knowledge Asset, receiving any programmatic emission, paying or receiving x402 or FairSwap settlements, or operating a Node, and for filing and paying any taxes and duties due.

10.9 **Testnet risk.** Testnets have no incentivization mechanisms and therefore cannot support the economic value propositions of OriginTrail V10 Mainnet. Testnet state, balances, NFTs, and histories may be reset, abandoned, or otherwise destroyed at any time without notice.

***
